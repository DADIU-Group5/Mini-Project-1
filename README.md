**Artist** can put their assets in the **_Assets/Resources_** folder. Remember that everything you do can always be undone on github. So don't be afraid.

### Steps for saving your stuff on github using SourceTree:

1. Pull (You will get the latest changes from our shared server)
2. Commit (You save your changes _locally_ similar to a checkpoint. Remember to write a meaningful message about what you have changed)
3. Push (You will save your committed changes to the shared server).
4. if in doubt you can always go to [github.com](https://github.com/DADIU-Group5/Mini-Project-1) and check if your file can be found on the website.



Ask a programmer if in doubt with anything.
