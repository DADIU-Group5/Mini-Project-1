# Mini Project 1
Mini game based on the book "Drengen der talte alting" (The boy who counted everything)

**Artists** can put their assets in the **_Assets/Resources_** folder. Remember that everything you do can always be undone on github, so don't be afraid.

### Steps for saving your stuff on github using SourceTree:

1. __Pull__ - You will get the latest changes from our shared server.
2. __Commit__ - Stage (select) the files you wish to commit. When committing you save your changes _locally_ similar to a checkpoint. Remember to write a meaningful message about what you have changed.
3. __Push__ - You will save your committed changes to the shared server.

If in doubt either ask a programmer or go to [github.com](https://github.com/DADIU-Group5/Mini-Project-1) and check if it contains the file you committed.

Good luck! :poop:
